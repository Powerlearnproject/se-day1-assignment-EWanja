#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the developing and maintaining of high-quality software systems

Importances in the technology industry.
1.It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.
2.It simplifies complex problems and solves those issues one by one.
3.As software systems become more complex, software engineering provides the frameworks and tools necessary to manage this complexity,


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of Fortran (1957)- Its introduction marked a significant step in making programming more accessible, allowing developers to write code using more human-readable syntax. 
2.Creation of the C Programming Language (1972) -  C became one of the most influential programming languages due to its flexibility, efficiency, and portability. It allowed for low-level memory manipulation while still providing high-level constructs, making it ideal for system programming, particularly operating systems 
3.The Advent of Structured Programming (1970s) -The introduction of structured programming concepts, Structured programming introduced a more disciplined approach to writing code, focusing on clear, logical structures like loops, conditionals, and subroutines, without the use of "goto" statements. This approach improved code readability, maintainability, and reliability, and became a cornerstone of modern programming practices.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after releasing the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology:
Linear & Sequential: Development follows a strict sequence of phases (e.g., requirements → design → implementation → testing → deployment).
Less Flexibility: Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
Best for: Projects with well-defined, stable requirements, like government or regulatory projects.

Agile Methodology:
Iterative & Incremental: Development occurs in cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback and adjustments.
Highly Flexible: Adaptable to changes throughout the project.
Best for: Dynamic projects with evolving requirements, like software startups or mobile app development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Overseeing the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs- provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples are Visual Studio, Eclipse 
*Importance*
Offers features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time error detection, which help developers write correct code faster and reduce the likelihood of bugs
Come with built-in debugging tools that allow developers to step through their code, set breakpoints, and inspect variables. 
Many modern IDEs support multiple programming languages and platforms, allowing developers to work on different types of projects within the same environment. 

VCS- tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members examples GitHub, Mercurial
*Importance*
VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other’s changes.
VCS tracks all modifications made to the code over time, allowing developers to see who made specific changes and when.
VCS supports branching, enabling developers to create separate lines of development for new features or experiments.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements
Tight Deadlines
Technical Debt
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit- testing individual components or modules of software
Unit testing ensures that the smallest building blocks of the software are reliable, and work as expected. It promotes code quality, reduces the number of defects, and makes debugging easier by isolating issues to specific units.

Integration - testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
Integration testing ensures that various parts of the system work together cohesively. It helps prevent issues that might only appear when modules interact, which could lead to failures in the overall system.

System - testing the entire software system as a whole.
System testing is crucial for identifying issues that may not have been detected during unit or integration testing. It ensures that the software meets the desired quality standards and behaves as expected under real-world conditions.

Acceptance - testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Acceptance testing is critical for ensuring that the software delivers the desired value to the end-users. It provides confidence that the software is ready for production and meets the business objectives.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

Importance:
It enhances user experience by designing effective prompts, users can interact with AI systems more intuitively and naturally.
Resource efficiency by crafting prompts that lead to more direct and relevant outputs, prompt engineering reduces the need for excessive computational resources
Customizing AI for specific use cases -prompt engineering allows developers and researchers to explore the capabilities of AI models in new and creative ways

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt :
Write a program that handles data.
Improved Prompt:
Write a Python program that reads a CSV file containing customer information (name, email, and purchase history), filters customers who made a purchase in the last 15 days, and outputs their names and emails to a new CSV file.
The improved prompt is more effective because it reduces ambiguity, ensures the developer knows exactly what is expected, and provides a clear path to completion. This leads to more accurate, efficient, and relevant outcomes
